# Solar-Drier-IoT-

<p>Solar Drier IoT is device which monitors the rate of dryness and moisture content of food crops. It basically dries the food crops to reduce it's moisture content. It is made up of a box which uses solar conductors and the principle of convection to reduce the moisture contents, then it measures the weight of the food crops to know if the moisture content has reduced.</p>
<p>It is an IoT device that is, it's data can be monitored real-time anywhere in the world. It also gives log on live weather and location updates</p>
